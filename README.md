Homework
Here's a homework guide to help students understand the basics of moving to GitHub:

Create a GitHub Account:

If students don't have a GitHub account, the first step is to create one. Visit GitHub and sign up.
Understand Version Control:

Learn the basics of version control using Git. Understand concepts like repositories, commits, branches, and pull requests. Resources like the Pro Git book can be helpful.
Install Git:

Install Git on your local machine. GitHub provides instructions for various operating systems here.
Create a Repository:

Create a new repository on GitHub. This can be a personal repository or a collaborative one if working on a group project.
Clone the Repository:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the git clone command. This creates a local copy of the repository on your computer.
Understand Branching:

Learn about branching in Git. Create a new branch for a specific feature or bug fix using the git branch and git checkout commands.
Make Changes and Commit:

Make changes to the files in your local repository. Use the git add command to stage changes and the git commit command to commit them.
Push Changes to GitHub:

Push your committed changes to the GitHub repository using the git push command. This syncs your local changes with the remote repository.
Pull Requests:

If working collaboratively, understand how to create a pull request. This is a way to propose changes and discuss them with collaborators before merging them into the main branch.
Collaboration:

Explore collaborative features like issues, milestones, and project boards on GitHub. Learn how to assign tasks, track progress, and communicate with collaborators.
Explore GitHub Pages:

GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository. Experiment with creating a simple GitHub Pages site.
Explore GitHub Actions:

GitHub Actions automate workflows. Explore how to set up simple workflows for tasks like testing and deployment.
Explore GitHub Classroom (if applicable):

If your class is using GitHub Classroom, familiarize yourself with how assignments are organized and submitted.
Read Documentation:

GitHub has extensive documentation. Spend some time exploring it to deepen your understanding of various features.
Attend GitHub Webinars or Workshops:

GitHub often conducts webinars and workshops. Attend one to learn more about advanced features and best practices.
This homework guide provides a structured approach to getting started with GitHub. It's essential for students to practice these concepts by working on sample projects or contributing to open-source projects to gain hands-on experience
